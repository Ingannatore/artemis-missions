# Ingannatore's Missions Pack for Artemis SBS

My missions take place in the **TSN RP Community** universe (http://www.terranstellarnavy.net/) and they require the **TSN Expansion** mod (downloadable here: http://www.terranstellarnavy.net/tsn-expansion/).

Feedback is always appreciated :)

## Mission "Miners and Pirates"

> The asteroids belts in the Promethean sector are rich in raw materials for the TSN.
> Your task is very simple: help the Promethean Command secure the sector from pirates.

* **Sector**: Promethean 
* **Ships**: TSN Horizon
* **Difficulty**: Low

A linear mission for crews made of new players; it's heavily guided by COMMS message, without any timer or expiration time.
